" * Terminal Settings

" `XTerm', `RXVT', `Gnome Terminal', and `Konsole' all claim to be "xterm";
" `KVT' claims to be "xterm-color":
if &term =~ 'xterm'

  " `Gnome Terminal' fortunately sets $COLORTERM; it needs <BkSpc> and <Del>
  " fixing, and it has a bug which causes spurious "c"s to appear, which can be
  " fixed by unsetting t_RV:
  if $COLORTERM == 'gnome-terminal'
"    execute 'set t_kb=' . nr2char(8)
    " [Char 8 is <Ctrl>+H.]
    fixdel
    set t_RV=

  " `XTerm', `Konsole', and `KVT' all also need <BkSpc> and <Del> fixing;
  " there's no easy way of distinguishing these terminals from other things
  " that claim to be "xterm", but `RXVT' sets $COLORTERM to "rxvt" and these
  " don't:
  elseif $COLORTERM == ''
 "   execute 'set t_kb=' . nr2char(8)
    fixdel

  " The above won't work if an `XTerm' or `KVT' is started from within a `Gnome
  " Terminal' or an `RXVT': the $COLORTERM setting will propagate; it's always
  " OK with `Konsole' which explicitly sets $COLORTERM to "".

" * User Interface

" have syntax highlighting in terminals which can display colours:
if has('syntax') && (&t_Co > 2)
  syntax on

" remember info for 10 files, but never any on removable disks, don't remember
" marks in files, don't rehighlight old search patterns, and only save up to

" but it causes an error for me:

" have command-line completion <Tab> (for filenames, help topics, option names)
" first list the available options and complete the longest common part, then
" have further <Tab>s cycle through the possibilities:
set wildmode=list:longest,full

" use "[RO]" for "[readonly]" to save space in the message line:
set shortmess+=r

" display the current mode and partially-typed commands in the status line:

" when using list, keep tabs at their full width and display `arrows':
execute 'set listchars+=tab:' . nr2char(187) . nr2char(183)

" have the mouse enabled all the time:

" * Text Formatting -- General

" don't make it look like there are line breaks where there aren't:
" set nowrap

" use indents of 2 spaces, and have them copied down lines:
set shiftwidth=4
set shiftround
set expandtab
set autoindent

" normally don't automatically format `text' as it is typed, IE only do this
" with comments, at 79 characters:
set formatoptions-=t

" get rid of the default style of C comments, and define a style with two stars
" at the start of `middle' rows which (looks nicer and) avoids asterisks used
" for bullet lists being treated like C comments; then define a bullet list
" style for single stars (like already is for hyphens):
set comments-=s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/
set comments+=s:/*,mb:**,ex:*/
set comments+=fb:*

" treat lines starting with a quote mark as comments (for `Vim' files, such as
" this very one!), and colons as well so that reformatting usenet messages from
" `Tin' users works OK:
set comments+=b:\"
set comments+=n::


" * Text Formatting -- Specific File Formats

" enable filetype detection:
filetype plugin indent on

" in human-language files, automatically format everything at 72 chars:
autocmd FileType mail,human set formatoptions+=t textwidth=72

" for C-like programming, have automatic indentation:
autocmd FileType c,cpp,slang set cindent

" for actual C (not C++) programming where comments have explicit end
" characters, if starting a new line in the middle of a comment automatically
" insert the comment leader characters:
autocmd FileType c set formatoptions+=ro

" for Perl programming, have things in braces indenting themselves:
autocmd FileType perl set smartindent

" for PHP programming, have things in braces indenting themselves:
autocmd FileType php set smartindent

" for CSS, also have things in braces indented:
autocmd FileType css set smartindent

" for HTML, generally format text, but if a long line has been created leave it
" alone when editing:
autocmd FileType html set formatoptions+=tl

" for both CSS and HTML, use genuine tab characters for indentation, to make
" files a few bytes smaller:
autocmd FileType html,css set noexpandtab tabstop=2

" in makefiles, don't expand tabs to spaces, since actual tab characters are
" needed, and have indentation at 8 chars to be sure that all indents are tabs
" (despite the mappings later):
autocmd FileType make set noexpandtab shiftwidth=8

" json stuff verbatim
augroup json_autocmd 
  autocmd! 
  autocmd FileType json set autoindent 
  autocmd FileType json set formatoptions=tcq2l 
  autocmd FileType json set shiftwidth=2 
  autocmd FileType json set softtabstop=2 tabstop=8 
  autocmd FileType json set expandtab 
  autocmd FileType json set foldmethod=syntax 
augroup END 

" * Search & Replace

" make searches case-insensitive, unless they contain upper-case letters:
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" show the `best match so far' as search strings are typed:
set incsearch

" assume the /g flag on :s substitutions to replace all matches in a line:
set gdefault


" try to avoid misspelling words in the first place -- have the insert mode
" <Ctrl>+N/<Ctrl>+P keys perform completion on partially-typed words by
" checking the Linux word list and the personal `Ispell' dictionary; sort out
" case sensibly (so that words at starts of sentences can still be completed
" with words that are in the dictionary all in lower case):

" correct my common typos without me even noticing them:
